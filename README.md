Cloud9 Emmet Extension
==========================

A [Cloud9ide](http://c9.io/) extension for [Emmet](http://emmet.io/) integration.


What is Emmet?
------------------

Emmet (known as Zen Coding) is a web-developer's toolkit that can greatly 
improve your HTML & CSS workflow.

Basically, most text editors out there allow you to store and re-use commonly 
used code chunks, called “snippets”. While snippets are a good way to boost 
your productivity, all implementations have common pitfalls: you have to define 
the snippet first and you can’t extend them in runtime.

Emmet takes the snippets idea to a whole new level: you can type CSS-like 
expressions that can be dynamically parsed, and produce output depending on 
what you type in the abbreviation. Emmet is developed and optimised for 
web-developers whose workflow depends on HTML/XML and CSS, but can be used with 
programming languages too.
